<h1>Food Delivery Service Backend</h1>
    <p>This project is a backend service written in Python using Django Rest Framework. It provides an app where users can place orders for meals to vendors. Users have multiple choices to even build a meal based on their categories, items, and sub-items that should be added to a meal. The app also links an order to a rider who will deliver the meal to the user's delivery address.</p>
